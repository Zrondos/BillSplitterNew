# Bill Splitting App

[Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjGFNpOoGWQ)


Web application developed for mobile use that lets you take a photo of your bill and assign friends to items, making calculations easy.

Create a profile or login using the demo username "test@test.com" and password "password"
Give a name to the event, upload a bill, and click analyze.
At the bottom of the bill page, add friends, then drag and drop friends to the items they ordered.
Click split to allow all your friends to view what they ordered, who they shared it with and how much they owe.

Some things about the app

* Built on Ruby on Rails
* Bill is generated by passing an image into a Optical Character Recognition API. This raw text is then parsed in order to create an item object with a name and price
* Authentication for login, sign up, password changes, account info update, delete account implemented via Devise


This app was developed as a team.
